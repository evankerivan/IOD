But if there are more pieces of code than CPU cores any running piece can be interrupted, put on the back burner, and the core assigned to another piece. The whole idea is: you don't control the relative order of execution of the pieces of code between themselves, unless you add specific control structures (lock, semaphores...). If you update a database for instance and the code reads a row, updates some fields and writes it back, you can get in situations like this:\n",

      "* \"multithreading\" is implementing the concurrency via \"threads\" that are units of execution inside a process. The great thing about threads is that threads in the same process access the same memory and I/O so the exchange of data between threads can happen at any time and is very fast. The dangerous thing about threads is that threads in the same process access the same memory and I/O so the exchange of data between threads can happen at any time and is very fast. The problem of Python is that due to a big central lock (the GIL), threads in a Python process can't execute code concurrently, so you can't use all your processor cores with a single process. Threads are still usable in the many cases where they are mostly used to wait for I/O (file access, network access). Some Python libraries can also use multithreading under the hood.\n",
